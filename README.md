- Full JXR of your project (tests included)
- SureFire report of your project
- Component diagram
- Packages diagram
- Classes diagram (one per package)
- Sequence diagram (as much as you need to explain the functioning your program) 
- A GIT report allowing to identify the production of each of the members of the team.
- All the other documents that you'll judge necessary (MCD, stored procedure, other diagrams, etc...)

## Evaluation

This project is covered by three evaluations :
- A personal grade (**Yes**/**No**)
- Two group grades (**A**/**B**/**C**/**D**)
	- A test booklet (with the **JavaDoc**, the **JXR of our tests**, and the **SureFire report**) 	
	- The project (**Functional**/**Design**/**Code**) 

## Advice 

The given architecture is absolutely not required to re-use. If you prefer to use your own, you can.
But please keep in mind that the entirety of the Maven Plugin are pre-installed, and you'll need them in order to generate all the documents required.


The design part of this project is really important. However, don't underestimate the time it takes to write your code.
At the very start of the project, fix yourself a deadline for the design part.

Making TDD seems to be a good choice too, as you'll be guaranteed to have a functional and tested project. It's always more difficult to write a test afterhand.
